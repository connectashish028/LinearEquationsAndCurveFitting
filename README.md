# Linear Equations And Curve Fitting

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook exploring various numerical methods in Python, including:

## Solving Linear Equations

- **Direct Solution:** Solving linear equations using NumPy's `linalg.solve` function.
- **Least Squares Method:** Handling overdetermined systems using `linalg.lstsq` and manual implementation.

## Interpolation

- **Linear Interpolation:** Estimating values between known points using NumPy's `interp` function.
- **SciPy Interpolation:** Exploring linear and cubic interpolation with `interp1d`, showcasing their differences.

## Curve Fitting

- **Linear Regression:** Modeling linear relationships using SciPy's `curve_fit` function.
- **Polynomial Regression:** Fitting data to polynomial models using NumPy's `polyfit` and `polyval` functions.
- **Custom Model Fitting:**  Demonstrating how to fit data to a sine wave model.
- **Dynamic System Modeling:** Applying least squares method for parameter estimation in a dynamic system context.
